      <h1>Getting started</h1>
      <p>The Back ticket Display is a JavaScript code that displays a list of tickets from a the Repair Desk API on a
        webpage. The list is organized by priority, with priority tickets being displayed at the top of the page. You
        can
        customize the code by editing the settings and options at the beginning of the file.</p>
      <p>To edit the code, you will need to use a text editor such as Notepad. First, open Notepad on your computer,
        then navigate to the location of where you unzipped the BTD folder. Look for the "js" folder and inside of there
        is a main.js file, this is the file you need to
        customize. Do not edit below where it says "// Do not edit beyond this line" as it may cause the code not to
        work.</p>
      <p>To customize the code, you will need to replace the values in the settings and options with your own. To change
        the API key for example, you will need to replace the value of RDapi with your own API key. Info on where to
        find that can be found <a href="https://help.repairdesk.co/knowledgebase/articles/1189105-public-api">here.</a>
      </p>
      <p>You can also customize the tickets shown by modifying the values in the priorityQue, regularQue, waitingQue,
        and schedQue arrays. These arrays contain the statuses of the tickets that will be included in each priority.
        For example, if you want to add a new ticket status to the priorityQue called "High Priority", you can do so by
        adding to the array like this:</p>
      <div class="example">let priorityQue = ["Same Day Repair", "RUSH - Priority Service","High Priority"];</div>

      <p>You can also customize the options for displaying the list of tickets.
        The waitingBool and schedBool option determines whether waiting or scheduled tickets should be displayed at the
        top of the page. Set this value to true if you want each of those ticket types to be displayed at the top, or
        false if you
        don't.</p>

      <p>The portVar option determines whether the page should be displayed in portrait or widescreen mode. Set this
        value to true for portrait mode or false for widescreen mode.</p>

      <p>Here is an example of a customized version of the settings and options area for a fictional company called
        Alice's
        Tech Support:</p>
      <p>In this example, Alice's Tech Support has customized the code to show waiting tickets at the top of the page
        and
        to display the page in widescreen mode. They have also removed scheduled tickets from the top of the page.</p>

      <div class="example">
        //Settings - Enter your ticket status and API key<br>
        let RDapi = "abc123-def456-ghi789-jkl012";<br>
        let priorityQue = ["Same Day Repair", "RUSH - Priority Service"];<br>
        let regularQue = ["Pending", "In Progress"];<br>
        let waitingQue = ["Waiting on Customer", "Waiting for Parts"];<br>
        let schedQue = ["Scheduled"];<br>
        <br>
        //Options<br>
        <br>
        //Add the waiting tickets at the top of the page<br>
        let waitingBool = true;<br>
        //Add scheduled tickets to the top of the page<br>
        let schedBool = false;<br>
        // Portrait = true ---- Widescreen = false<br>
        let portVar = false;

      </div>



      <p>Once you have made your desired changes to the code, save the file by clicking "File" in the top menu and
        selecting "Save." Then, you can use the code to display the list of tickets on your computer.</p>

      <p class="important">Note: Make sure to keep the structure of the code, including the syntax and formatting, when
        making your changes.
        Incorrect syntax or formatting can cause the code to not work as intended. Do not edit below where it says "//
        Do not edit beyond this line" as it may cause the code not to
        work.</p>
